    <h1>The best anime according to Mark</h1>
    <h2>My top 10 anime of all time</h2>
    <hr />

    <ul>
      <li><h3>Naruto</h3></li>
      <img

    <p>
      This much is obvious there's no mentioning anime without naruto. This was
      my first and best anime and if given the time will definitely rewatch it.
      From the protagonists to even to the antagonists this anime is just
      perfect. the one anime that you even get to love some of the villians more
      than the protagonists. Now to read a little about why i think Naruto is
      the best anime and in a bid to concince you to watch it
      <a href="https://screenrant.com/naruto-best-shonen-jump-big-3/"> here </a>
      to read up. Similar links will be posted in the other animes to see why
      they are so good.

      <li><h3>Bleach</h3></li>
      <img src="bleach.webp" />
    </ul>
    <p>
      Now this is that anime that if not for the numerous spoilers it got it
      would have just been perfect. Kurosaki ichigo the human thats a shinigami
      also has hollow power and quincy powers like how over powered can someone
      get. But well he wasnt even the strongest in the verse but this is a
      really good anime. Done even get me started on the wide variety of
      characters and personalities they have from Aizen to kisuke the arrancars,
      espadas its just so much. Read up
      <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Bleach-such-a-great-anime">here </a>
      and as you read up you will also see them mention the fact that the
      fillers made the anime look bad but even with that it was still a great
      anime

      not all will have links to read up maybe just 5 will.

      characters to relatable villian. just
